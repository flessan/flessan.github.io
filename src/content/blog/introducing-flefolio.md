Hello and welcome! I'm incredibly excited to launch my new personal space on the web: **FleFolio**.

This project was born out of a desire to create a modern, performant, and visually appealing platform to showcase my work, share my thoughts, and document my journey as a Software Engineering student. It's more than just a portfolio; it's a digital garden and a playground for experimentation.

### The Philosophy Behind FleFolio

My goal was to build a site that is:
- **Fast & Performant**: Leveraging the best of modern web technologies to deliver a snappy user experience.
- **Clean & Readable**: Both in terms of its UI design and its code structure.
- **Content-Driven**: Using a simple yet effective Markdown-based system to manage projects and blog posts.
- **Extendable**: Built on a solid foundation that can be easily expanded with new features in the future.

### Peeking at the Tech Stack

I chose a tech stack that I'm passionate about and that represents the cutting edge of web development today:

-   **Next.js (App Router)**: For its powerful Server Components, intuitive file-based routing, and excellent overall developer experience. The App Router allows for fine-grained control over rendering and data-fetching strategies.
-   **React**: The heart of the UI, allowing for dynamic and interactive components built with a declarative API.
-   **TypeScript**: To ensure type safety, improve code quality, and make the codebase more robust and maintainable.
-   **Tailwind CSS**: For a rapid, utility-first styling approach that is highly customizable without ever leaving my HTML.
-   **Shadcn/ui**: A beautifully designed, accessible, and unstyled collection of components that is an absolute joy to work with. It's not a component library, but rather a set of reusable components I can copy and paste into my app and customize.
-   **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: The entire site is pre-rendered into static HTML at build time, ensuring maximum performance and SEO benefits. This is perfect for deploying on platforms like GitHub Pages.

### What's Inside?

-   **Projects**: A curated list of my work, with details on the tech used, challenges faced, and links to live demos and source code.
-   **Blog**: A space for me to write about technology, web development, coding tutorials, and anything else I find interesting. Each post is rendered from Markdown.
-   **CV**: An interactive and printable version of my professional resume, also sourced from a Markdown file for easy updates.
-   **Code::Stats Integration**: A fun little section on the "About" page to visualize my coding activity and language distribution, fetched directly from the Code::Stats API.

### Future Plans

This is more than just a portfolio; it's a living project that I will continue to evolve. Some features I'm considering for the future include:
- More advanced search functionality.
- Adding comments to blog posts.
- Implementing more interactive data visualizations.

I hope you enjoy exploring FleFolio as much as I enjoyed building it. Feel free to browse my projects, read my articles, and connect with me!
