Hello and welcome! I'm excited to launch my new personal space on the web: **FleFolio**.

This project was born out of a desire to create a modern, performant, and aesthetically pleasing platform to showcase my work, share my thoughts, and document my journey as a developer.

### The Tech Stack

I chose a stack that I'm passionate about and that represents the cutting edge of web development today:

-   **Next.js (App Router)**: For its powerful server-side rendering capabilities, file-based routing, and overall developer experience.
-   **React**: The core of the UI, allowing for dynamic and interactive components.
-   **TypeScript**: To ensure type safety and improve code quality.
-   **Tailwind CSS**: For a utility-first approach to styling that is both rapid and maintainable.
-   **Shadcn/ui**: A fantastic collection of beautifully designed components that are a joy to work with.

### What's Inside?

-   **Projects**: A curated list of my work, with details on the technologies used and links to live demos and source code.
-   **Blog**: A space for me to write about technology, web development, and anything else I find interesting.
-   **CV**: An interactive and printable version of my professional resume.

This is more than just a portfolio; it's a living project that I will continue to evolve. I hope you enjoy exploring it as much as I enjoyed building it.
