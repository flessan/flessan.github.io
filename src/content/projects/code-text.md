- Save, load, or reset your work using `localStorage`  
- Drag & drop `.txt` or `.md` files straight into the editor  

### 💻 Code Cleaner

- *Minify HTML*, *Clean CSS*, and *Clean JS*  
- Auto-remove code comments  
- Basic HTML pretty-printing (nicer indentation)  
- Live preview in a secure sandboxed iframe  
- One-click copy or export of results  

### 🔡 HTML Decoder  
> Turn HTML entities into readable text—and vice versa.

- Manual encode/decode toggle  
- Auto-detect and decode on the fly  
- Copy decoded/encoded output with a single click  

### 🔀 Combine Tool  
> Merge separate HTML, CSS, and JS snippets into one neat HTML file.

## 🎨 Design & UI

Built with a **Modern Glassmorphism** vibe:
- Soft base colors: `#f5f7ff` & `#f0f2ff`  
- Purple/indigo accents (`#6366f1`, `#a855f7`)  
- Subtle shadows + transparent blur layers  
- Smooth fade, slide, and hover animations  
- Fully responsive—from desktop to mobile  

---

## ⚙️ File Structure

- `index.html` → Main layout & structure  
- `style.css` → Glassmorphism styling (inline or external)  
- `sc.js` → Core logic (tabs, transforms, combine, split, etc.)

---

## 📦 How to Use It

1. Open `index.html` in any browser (**works offline!**)  
2. Pick your tool: **Text / Code / Decoder / Combine / Split**  
3. Paste your content or drag & drop a file  
4. Hit an action button (e.g., `Minify`, `Decode`, `Split`)  
5. Copy, save, or download the result  

---

## 💾 Auto-Save Magic

> Every 5 seconds, your text gets saved to `localStorage`.  
Close the tab or refresh? No worries—your last session loads right back up.

---

## 🔐 Privacy & Security

- **100% runs in your browser**—zero server contact  
- Your data never leaves your machine  
- Previews run in a locked-down **sandboxed iframe** for safety  

---

## 📱 Mobile-Friendly AF

Looks great on any screen:
- Sidebar becomes a sticky top bar on small screens  
- Flexible components adapt smoothly  
- Fonts and spacing scale down cleanly to 480px
