This tool empowers users to transform raw data into beautiful, interactive visualizations without writing a single line of code.

### Key Features

*   **Drag-and-Drop Interface:** Users can easily upload CSV files and map data columns to different chart axes.
*   **Variety of Chart Types:** Supports bar charts, line graphs, scatter plots, and pie charts.
*   **Interactive Dashboards:** Combine multiple charts into a single dashboard for a comprehensive overview.
*   **Customization:** Extensive options for customizing colors, labels, and tooltips.

The front-end is built with **React**, managing the application state and UI. For the charting library, I chose **D3.js** due to its immense power and flexibility, allowing for the creation of completely custom and highly interactive visualizations. State management is handled with React's Context API to keep the application lightweight.
