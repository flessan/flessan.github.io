A full-featured e-commerce platform built from scratch, providing a robust, scalable, and secure solution for online businesses. The goal was to create a production-ready application that covers the entire user journey, from browsing products to secure checkout and order management.

### Admin Dashboard Features

The platform includes a secure, role-protected admin dashboard with comprehensive management tools:

*   **Product Management:** Admins can easily add, edit, and remove products. This includes managing multiple images, inventory tracking (stock-keeping units or SKUs), pricing, and categorizing items.
*   **Order Management:** A centralized view to process customer orders, update shipping statuses (e.g., 'Processing', 'Shipped', 'Delivered'), handle returns, and view order details.
*   **User Management:** Oversee customer accounts, view order histories, and manage admin roles and permissions.
*   **Analytics:** Basic sales analytics, showing revenue over time, top-selling products, and new customer acquisition.

### Customer-Facing Features

The storefront is designed to be intuitive, fast, and mobile-friendly:

*   **Product Browsing & Filtering:** Customers can browse products by category, apply filters (e.g., by price, brand, size), and sort results.
*   **Advanced Search:** A search bar with auto-suggestions to help customers find products quickly.
*   **Shopping Cart:** Persistent shopping cart functionality that syncs between devices for logged-in users.
*   **Secure Checkout:** Multi-step checkout process with integration with **Stripe** for secure credit card payment processing.
*   **User Accounts:** Customers can create accounts, view their order history, manage shipping addresses, and track current shipments.
*   **Product Reviews:** Users can leave reviews and ratings on products they've purchased.

### Technical Architecture

The application is built on the **MERN** stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), with some additional technologies to enhance functionality.

#### Backend (API)
The back-end is a RESTful API built with **Node.js** and the **Express** framework.
- **Authentication**: Implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Passwords are encrypted using `bcrypt`. Routes are protected using custom middleware that verifies the JWT and user roles.
- **Database**: **MongoDB** with **Mongoose** serves as the database. Mongoose provides a schema-based solution to model application data, which was crucial for defining structures for products, users, and orders.
- **File Uploads**: Handled image uploads for products using `multer` to process `multipart/form-data`, with images stored on a cloud storage service like AWS S3 or Cloudinary.

```javascript
// Example of a protected route in Express
import express from 'express';
import { protect, admin } from '../middleware/authMiddleware.js';
import { createProduct } from '../controllers/productController.js';

const router = express.Router();

// @desc   Create a new product
// @route  POST /api/products
// @access Private/Admin
router.route('/').post(protect, admin, createProduct);
```

#### Frontend
The front-end is a single-page application (SPA) created with **React**.
- **State Management**: **Redux Toolkit** is used for global state management, handling the shopping cart, user authentication status, and fetched product data. This provides a predictable and centralized state container.
- **Routing**: `react-router-dom` handles client-side routing.
- **UI Components**: Built with a custom component library styled with **Tailwind CSS** for a consistent and responsive design.
- **Data Fetching**: The frontend communicates with the backend API using `axios`, with Redux Toolkit's `createAsyncThunk` to handle the asynchronous logic of fetching and updating data.

### Security Considerations

Security was a top priority. Measures taken include:
- Hashing all user passwords.
- Implementing JWT-based authentication and authorization.
- Protecting against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) by sanitizing user input.
- Using environment variables to store sensitive information like database connection strings and API keys.
- Integrating with Stripe, a PCI-compliant payment processor, to avoid handling sensitive credit card data directly.
